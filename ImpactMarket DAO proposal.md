# Title
Creation of a referall program

# Short Description
The purpose of this proposal is the creation of a referral program to incentivize members of the community to invite new users to join the community.

# Scope
The purpose of the creation of a referral program is to incentivize members of the community to invite new users to join the community by awarding them a reward in the form of PACT token.

More in detail, the more a person attracts people to join the community, the more PACT token he receives as a reward. 
First, I think that it would increase community engagement. By incentivizing existing community members to invite their friends and colleagues to join the DAO, the program can help to expand the DAO's reach and bring in new users who are interested for donation. In addition, as existing community members refer their friends and colleagues to the platform, they are effectively vouching for the platform's value and quality. This can help to build trust and credibility, which can be important for attracting new users, donors and investors.

Second, I think that it could increase trading volume. As more users join the community through the referral program, they may be more likely to trade their PACT tokens, which can lead to increased liquidity and more trading opportunities for existing users. Which is interesting for investors.
Moreover, referral programs can provide incentives for traders and investors to remain engaged with the community. For example, the program could offer extra rewards for them, such as discounted trading fees or access to exclusive features.

Finally, by implementing a referral program would bring more users in the platform and thus more donors. In the end it will also be interesting for beneficiaries because more projects could be funded

Every category of token holder could find a benefice through the referral program.
